    Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;
    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
    Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
    Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
    Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
    Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
            Then the bird said “Nevermore.”
    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;

On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”
    It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
    Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
    “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—
    Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”

    On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,

    Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
    Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”
    “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
    And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”
    “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—

            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
    Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—
    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”


    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being

            This it is and nothing more.”

Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—

    Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
            Only this and nothing more.”
    Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—
    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
            She shall press, ah, nevermore!
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;

    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
    “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating

    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
    But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,

            She shall press, ah, nevermore!
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;
    Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
            Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”



            With such name as “Nevermore.”
    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”
    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.

    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”
    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”
    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,
    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
            Nameless here for evermore.
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
    And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;

Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
    Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
    Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—
    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
    “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
            Darkness there and nothing more.
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
            Nameless here for evermore.
    Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
    Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
