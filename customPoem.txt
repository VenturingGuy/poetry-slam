            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
            With such name as “Nevermore.”
            Then the bird said “Nevermore.”
            Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”
            Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”
            She shall press, ah, nevermore!
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
            Shall be lifted—nevermore!
